# Landmark-Classification-and-Tagging-for-Social-Media

The task at hand is to build a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model to automatically predict the location of an image based on any landmarks depicted in the image. The notebooks and corresponding ./src files demonstrate how to build such a model using PyTorch. First a CNN architecture is built from scratch and tested. After some tests and benchmarks, transfer learning is used to fine-tune a pretrained CNN model on the datset. This greatly enhances prediction accuracy. Finally a simple app is created to upload a landmark image and see if the model classifies it correctly.
